# Security Best Practices for AfriTix

## Sensitive Credentials Management

### Service Account Keys

1. **Never commit service account keys to version control**
   - Always add key files to `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables or secure vaults in CI/CD

2. **Restrict access to service account keys**
   - Only share with team members who need them
   - Use the principle of least privilege

3. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Create new keys every 3-6 months
   - Revoke old keys after rotation

### API Keys and Secrets

1. **Use environment variables for API keys**
   - Store in `.env` files locally (add to `.gitignore`)
   - Use secure environment variables in CI/CD

2. **Implement key rotation**
   - Regularly rotate all API keys and secrets
   - Have a process for emergency key rotation

3. **Use different keys for different environments**
   - Development keys should be different from production
   - Restrict production key access

## User Data Protection

1. **Encrypt sensitive user data**
   - Use strong encryption for PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
   - Implement proper key management

2. **Implement proper authentication**
   - Use secure authentication methods
   - Implement MFA where possible

3. **Follow data minimization principles**
   - Only collect data you need
   - Have clear data retention policies

4. **Secure data in transit**
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Implement certificate pinning for mobile apps

## Supabase Security

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Implement RLS policies for all tables
   - Test policies thoroughly

2. **API Security**
   - Use the anon key only for public operations
   - Use service role key only on secure server environments

3. **Authentication Security**
   - Configure proper password policies
   - Implement email verification

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Regularly review database access patterns
   - Check for unauthorized access

## Mobile App Security

1. **Secure Local Storage**
   - Use `expo-secure-store` for sensitive data
   - Never store plain text credentials

2. **Code Obfuscation**
   - Implement code obfuscation for production builds
   - Hide sensitive business logic

3. **Certificate Pinning**
   - Implement certificate pinning for API calls
   - Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks

4. **Secure Deep Links**
   - Validate all deep link parameters
   - Implement proper authentication for deep links

## Deployment Security

1. **CI/CD Security**
   - Secure your CI/CD pipeline
   - Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities

2. **Environment Isolation**
   - Keep development, staging, and production environments separate
   - Restrict access to production environments

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Apply security patches promptly

4. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Implement regular vulnerability scanning
   - Address critical vulnerabilities immediately

## Incident Response

1. **Have an incident response plan**
   - Document steps to take in case of a security breach
   - Assign responsibilities to team members

2. **Regular Security Training**
   - Train all team members on security best practices
   - Keep the team updated on new threats

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Implement logging for security events
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

4. **Regular Backups**
   - Implement regular database backups
   - Test restoration procedures

## Compliance
